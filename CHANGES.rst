================

- Added support for ``mode``, ``user``, and ``group`` options.

  that case the default path (``parts/<sectionname>``) was created
  instead of the given one.

- Shortened main code.

- Updated tests to run with ``zc.buildout`` 1.5, thus requiring at least this

- Renamed ``path`` option to ``paths`` (plural). Please do not use

- Changed default behaviour: directories created once will not be

- Added new option ``remove-on-update``: if set to ``yes``, ``true``
  or ``on`` the set directories will be removed on updates of
  ``buildout`` configuration.
